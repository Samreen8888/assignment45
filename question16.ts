// • Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.

// • Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

// • Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. 
// • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
